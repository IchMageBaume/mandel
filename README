I have no idea how .md's work lol

I like math, fractals and programming, so here is a cuda-accellerated command line
mandelbrot generator. I'll probably be working on a gui-based mandelbrot explorer
soon, only one free and good is slow and has no option to use gpu, which does
at least a 10x speedup here.
